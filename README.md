## Diabetes-Prediction ##

This project provides a diabetes prediction model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel and logistic regression. The model is trained on a dataset containing various health metrics and is used to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on input features. The user interacts with the model through a Streamlit web application.

## HOW TO USE ##

Install Dependencies

1.Ensure you have Python/VS code installed and then install the necessary packages:



pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn pickle streamlit

2.Prepare Data

Ensure you have the dataset Cardetails.csv containing car details.

3.Run the Application

Start the Streamlit application in installed IDE run app.py the main script there and then in terminal run:

-streamlit run app.py

This will launch a web server, and you can access the application through the URL provided by Streamlit in your browser.
