## Diabetes-Prediction ##

This project provides a diabetes prediction model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel and logistic regression. The model is trained on a dataset containing various health metrics and is used to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on input features. The user interacts with the model through a Streamlit web application.
